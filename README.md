# Server-details




This project gives detailed information about the server who is the user, date and time, Server Uptime, last login activities, Disk utilization, RAM utilization, and Top CPU Processes Running. This project is made using Shell-Scripting, the script can be executed using the bash. I've also taken a backup of this script in the form of a zip file. Some extra commands are also used just to beautify the project.
